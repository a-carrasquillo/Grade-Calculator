# Grade-Calculator
Grade calculator using VBA

Grade calculator for four to six grades. Using a form it recopilates the student information, like the 
name, last name/s, student number, university, gender, faculty that the student belongs, concentration, 
class, semester, number of evaluations, absences, the grades' individual weights, the grades themselves, 
and at the end the program calculates the final grade and we are able to send the information to the 
excel worksheet.
